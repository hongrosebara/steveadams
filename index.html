                  Throughout this true story, Steven has seamlessly merged many
                  worlds, from wild adventure to the ecosphere of a coma, from
                  the high drama of life lived on a knife’s edge, to the
                  overcoming of adversity in the form of total blindness. During
                  the course of these pages it is impossible to guess which way
                  the story will turn, and I was kept on the edge of my seat in
                  a constant rollercoaster of psychology, intellect, daring,
                  beautiful imagery, adventure and deep thought processes, to
                  name a few.

            He has taken me on a journey into domains I had no idea existed and
            has shown me the lighter side of life, in situations appearing too
            dark to be laughed at. He has given me a totally different
            perspective on how to move forward when life seems difficult to
            face. Above all, it is entertainment at its best.

          <p>
            Journey Through The Mirror has a stand alone style and it is fair to
            say, it is unique.

            Steve Adams was born in Albany, Western Australia in 1968. His life
            has been filled with adventure both in Australia and all over the
            world. Being blinded in an accident 14 years ago, changed the course
            of his life and he now lives quietly in the countryside of WA, with
            his wife Diana and two children.
